"Course Objectives and Overview"
"In Korea, research on national security and national information has not been very active. "
"This is because"
"\ndiscussions of national security and national information have been underway since the North-South division and the Cold War."
"\n "
"In particular, while national security and system security are identified, this phenomenon is intensified."
"\n. "
"For this reason, most people do not believe that national intelligence agencies as a central agency to national security."
"\nbut a political inspectorate for security rights. "
"But internally, the progress of democratization,"
"\nand the advent of the post-cold war externally, requires new perceptions of national security and national information. "
"\nIn particular, the end of the Cold War obscured the notion of enemy and allies, and broadened the concept of national security."
"\n. "
"It is hard to understand. "
"\nExisting national security concepts include dynamic new landscapes of post-cold war, globalization and democratization."
"According to these internal and external changes, the purpose, function and role of the national intelligence agency"
"\nis changing radically.  "
"\nOn the basis of this realization, this course deals with the concept of national security that is becoming wider and the correlation between parts."
"\nBasic purpose of the course is to try. "
"\nto analyze the relationship and comparatively examine the theory and practice on the link between national security and national information."
"Especially in the case of Korea, the existing academic"
"\ndiscussions and literature are minimal, this course will help opening up a new field"
"\nto point out the greater meaning of the class."
"This lecture is not only about theoretical discussion."
"\nIt includes case analysis to improve understanding of national security and national information, and through student presentations,"
"\nto inspire the studnets to participate."
