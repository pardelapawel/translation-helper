"\nEveryone wants to be happy, so politics also aims at human happiness."
"\nPolitical ideology or philosophy is simply an idea of ​​politics, "
"\nand it is the reasoning and deliberation to maximize the common good and happiness "
"\nof the members of the social community."
"\nPolitics generally implies the use of power at the national level, which is the best typical "
"\nsocial group that exerts more dominance than any other community, as long as there is no "
"\nsystemic government of the whole world."
"\nThe state of governance and system has been recognized as one of the key conditions in determining "
"\nthe well-being of individual members, if not all, in the human history. In pursuit of better development "
"\nin nature, we need to know whether a governmental structure of the State is needed, what is the political system "
"\nof the ideal state, and what is the difference between the ideal political system and the reality of the "
"\nRepublic of Korea, and thorough analysis and synthesis will be necessary."
"\nThis is because development is no different from the process of bringing reality or phenomena into "
"\nharmony with ideals or essence."
"\n  Political philosophy is philosophy before it is political science."
"\nThis is because philosophy, regardless of the East or the West, is the source of all academic inquiry in its origin."
"\nAristotle's <Politika>, for example, is mostly about a political philosophy, while is recognized as the first political work of the West."
"\nAlso, on <Ethika Nikomacheia>, one of his representative philosophical works, the discussion is based on the clarification of personal and social ethics. "
"\nIntroducing philosophy and understanding the implications of philosophy is the most reliable way to practice philosophy and it must lie in the path of the history of philosophers."
"\nThis is because the history of philosophy continues to accumulate long-standing and disregarded experiences since the dawn of human culture, carrying out a refinement of them."
"\n  However, the study and education of political thought in the political departments of leading universities "
"\nin Korea is crippling by setting the starting point of discussion at the modernity with Niccolò Machiavelli."
"\nThis situation is not only a disregard of a large part of the human experience, which can not be ignored, but also a sad folly of simply overlooking the noble and daring idealistic tradition."
"\nModern political ideology is obviously indebted to the great research achievements of the early middle ages, and for many researchers, "
"\nmodern contemporary ideology may not be a vestibule that thoroughly overcomes the middle ages political philosophy."
"\nAncient and medieval thoughts never remain in naive primitive intuition."
"\nThe philosophy of the ancient and middle ages devalues ​​them as much as possible and calls them a monotonous list of symbolic, theoretical, and analogous elements,"
"\nbut is already preoccupied with anticipating the general development of modern and modern ideas."
"\nThe link between modern and modern philosophy is loose, but ancient times and the Middle Ages show us a single system of thought that has a whole unity."
"\nFor the junior politics of this semester will have a critical opportunity to enjoy the value and power of Western "
"\nancient- and middle-aged political ideology in which classes are being forcibly oblivious to oblivion. "
"\nHope to have a place of worship of the beauty of ideas that we are missing today."
