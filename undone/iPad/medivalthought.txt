"The governing pattern and system of the state, if not all, is truly"
"\nIt has been recognized as one of the key conditions that determine the well-being of individual members."
"\nAll. "

"\nWhether it is necessary for the future, what should be the political system of the ideal state,"
"\nSerious analysis and analysis of what differences exist between Korea and the reality of Korea"
"\nIt is necessary to carry out a summation, and development is the process of bringing reality or phenomenon into conformity"
"\nBecause there is no difference.  "
"\n  Political philosophy is philosophy before it is political science. "
"Because philosophy is the origin of both East and West"
"\nThat's why we are the source of all academic inquiry. "
"Aristotle, for example,"
"\nAlthough Politika was recognized as the first political science work in the West,"
"\nEthika, one of his representative philosophical works, while forming a dragon mass "

"\nMuna is also a place of sad folly that is easily overlooked. "
"Modern politics"
"\nThought is obviously indebted to the great achievements of the early Middle Ages,"
"\nThe modern political ideology of the former ruler is a jeongjeong edition that thoroughly overcomes the high and middle age political philosophy. "
"\nIt may not be. "
"Ancient and medieval thought never remains in naive primitive intuition."
"\n. "
"High and medium-sized philosophies devalue them as much as possible,"
"\nEven if we call it the monotonous image of candles, we have already "
"\nAnticipated and preoccupied. "
"The link between modern and contemporary philosophy is loose, but ancient and medieval"
"\nIt shows us one system of thought with human unity. "
"Junior politics"
"\nThe value of Western high- and middle-aged political ideology in which Wie was forced to forget the class this semester."
