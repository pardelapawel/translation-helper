"Course Objectives and Overview"
"In Korea, research on national security and national information has not been very active. "
"this is"
"\nDiscussions of national security and national information have been underway since the North-South division and the Cold War."
"\nBecause. "
"In particular, while national security and system security are identified, this phenomenon is intensified."
"\ncome. "
"For this reason, most people do not believe that national intelligence agencies are central to national security."
"\nIt has been recognized as a political inspectorate for security rights. "
"But internally, the progress of democratization,"
"\nExternally, the advent of the post-cold war requires new perceptions of national security and national information. "
"\nIn particular, the end of the Cold War obscured the notion of enemy and comrades, and broadened the concept of national security."
"\ncome. "
"Existing national security concepts include dynamic new landscapes of post-cold war, globalization and democratization."
"\nIt is hard to understand. "
"According to these internal and external changes, the purpose, function and role of the national intelligence agency"
"\nIt's changing radically.  "
"\nOn the basis of this recognition, this course deals with the concept of national security that is becoming wider and the correlation between parts."
"\nAnalyze the relationship and comparatively examine the theory and practice on the link between national security and national information"
"\nThere is a basic purpose to try. "
"Especially in the case of Korea, the existing academic"
"\nBecause the discussions and literature are minimal, this course will open up a new field."
"\nIt is said that the meaning is even greater. "
"This lecture is not only about theoretical discussion,"
"\nCase analysis to improve understanding of national security and national information, and through student presentations"
"\nIt will inspire the people to participate."
