* The first hour is a guide to the class. 
We will talk about the purpose of this course, 
the difference between political science and law and 
the perspective of law as a political student, 
the characteristics and study of law subjects, the meaning of constitutionalism, 
and the meaning of justice as an ideology of law. 
Students are encouraged to attend the first class. 
Every Friday, 
there are discussions about current affairs and related laws for 30 minutes.

* Below is a brief introduction to the themes we want to cover in this class (some of which may be omitted).

* With regard to each theme, we will introduce abundantly the leading cases among Korean and foreign precedents so that students can feel the law more closely. We will present to YSCEC a precedent to read in the future.
